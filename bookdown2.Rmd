## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Monthly Observer Data
```{sql,echo=FALSE,max.print = 15}
SELECT name,Ymd as Date,g ,s as "Groups" ,w as Wolf ,k FROM daily
```

## Observer Summary Data
```{sql, echo=FALSE}
SELECT name,count(*)as Count FROM daily GROUP BY name
```

# You can also embed plots, for example:
```{sql, connection=mydb, output.var="daily"}
Select * from daily
```
```{r}
qplot(daily$jd,daily$w)

```
